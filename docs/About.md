# About Taproot
Here are some thoughts about what this project is meant to be. These will be refined and added to as we go.

### Taproot is a handbook, not an encyclopedia
The main focus is information about how to do things rather than about things. Since the site and its users have a goal in mind, certain design opportunities are opened up such as gamification and the creation of specialized tools to help users make decisions or achieve a goal.

### User-generated content
The content of Taproot needs to be editable by users. This is important for practical reasons (we can’t write it all ourselves) and for other reasons (we want to create a community). We might, however, want to explore other options for collecting this content besides the standard "edit markup" → "moderator review" → "publish" model. We could, for example, have users generate small tutorial pages which could be ranked by the community and be promoted on the site accordingly or we could have users rate their experience using certain techniques without having to edit any markup. Our domain-specific focus (i.e. gardening & food production) may warrant more specialized kinds of user-generated content. It could be more of a social or community-oriented platform than a traditional wiki (think: mix of Reddit and Wikipedia).
