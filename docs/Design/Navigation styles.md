### Types of navigation
Users may navigate the site in different ways [depending on their category](/docs/Design/Users.md) (i.e. how much they know already).

1. By taking courses. These courses direct them through curated sets of content and are based on different, broad areas of interest. They are meant to help users discover whole new topics they weren't aware of and guide them when they have only a very vague idea of what they need (i.e. *I want to start a garden, I want to improve my garden*).
2. By navigating from page to page as their needs change or become more clear by learning more (i.e. progressing from an ailment diagnosis to a cure). This is for users who know a little bit and who are on a journey towards a specific destination, even if they don't know exactly what it is at first. The tools are mostly designed for these users who know specifically what they want to find out but need help finding the information.
3. By searching for things directly and landing on the pages they need. This is for the most informed users who know exactly what they're looking for.
