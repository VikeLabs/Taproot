### Types of users
The purpose of Taproot is to connect users with the information that they need. We can understand how the site needs to be organized and developed only by understanding the users. A useful way to categorize them is according to how much they already know (instead of according to the information theyâ€™re looking for, as I had originally thought). 

The following three types of users are roughly correlated to three different [styles of site navigation](/docs/Navigation%20styles.md).

1. Some users will know very few specifics and mostly have general ideas like *"I want to start a garden"* or *"I want to learn more about gardening"*. The courses are designed for these users.
2. Other users will know what they're looking for but need some help finding it. These will tend to be situations when the user has a specific question such as *"what should I plant in my garden?"* or *"what is going wrong with my plants?".* The tools are designed for these users.
3. The third category of users will have a specific question AND know where to find the answer. They will have questions like *"how do I add more phosphorus to my soil?"* or *"when should I plant onions?"* and can search for specific pages or topics to find the information that they need. The search feature is designed for these users.
